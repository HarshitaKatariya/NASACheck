        <h2>All About Exoplanets</h2>
        <p>Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars other than the sun and thus exist outside the solar system. The word "exoplanet" derives from the term "extrasolar planet," which hints at its existence beyond the influence of our star.</p><br>
        <p>Prior to the 1990s, humanity had never observed a planet beyond the solar system and thus could not confirm such worlds existed. In the more than three decades since the first discovery of an exoplanet, NASA's exoplanet catalog has burgeoned. As of 2023, the exoplanet catalog contains over 5,500 confirmed exoplanets and almost 10,000 additional candidate exoplanets.</p><br>
        <p>Exoplanets that orbit in the so-called habitable zone — the region around their star where it's not too hot or too cold to sustain liquid water — are targets for the search for life outside the solar system.</p><br>
        <h2>Can life survive on exoplanets?</h2>  
        <p>That depends on the exoplanet. The chances of life existing on an exoplanet are significantly greater if that planet exists in the habitable zone of its star. Astronomers are also currently becoming aware of the possibility of "Hycean worlds." These planets are dominated by liquid oceans and could hang on to liquid water outside standard habitable zones, thus widening the potential area around a star in which life could exist.</p><br>
        <h2>Can humans go to exoplanets?</h2>
        <p>Currently, the closest exoplanet to Earth is Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the star Proxima Centauri, located 4 light-years away. The crew-carrying module of the Artemis missions is Orion, which, according to its maker, Lockheed Martin, has a top speed of 24,000 mph (39,000 km/h). 
  
          That means that traveling constantly at this top speed and assuming no diversions, it would take Orion over 1 billion hours to reach Proxima Centauri. That's more than 114,000 years, so until the invention of light-speed travel or suspended animation , it is not possible to travel to an exoplanet.</p><br>
          <h2>How many planets are exoplanets?</h2>
          <p>Over 5,500 exoplanets have been discovered so far, with a further 9,900 suspected exoplanets awaiting confirmation. All this has happened since 1992, so these numbers are likely to change frequently. Fortunately, NASA's exoplanet catalog is updated continually, so you can check the updated list of the number of exoplanets discovered.</p>
